# A-revolution-detector

This is the code and some data supporting Leroi et al. On Revolutions.
It contains:
(1) a data file with Hot100 Pop music data
(2) the revolution caculator, and plot commands, implemented in R
(3) the persistence estimator (rho).  There are two code files required for this:  an R file which, in turn, calls a Stan file.
