# A revolution detector

This is the code and some data supporting Leroi et al. On Revolutions.
It contains:
(1) a data file with all the data used in the study
(2) the Foote Novelty algorithm, the permutation test, and plot functions implemented in R
(3) the persistence estimator (rho).  There are two code files required for this:  an R file which, in turn, calls a Stan file.
